# Movie Tracker
Movie Track allows users to see the latest releases hitting theaters. Users can create an account, log in, and save their favorite movies.

## Set Up
Create a new directory to hold both your frontend and backend directories.

Go to https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker and clone the back-end repo into your new file, following instructions in repo to get it up and running.

Clone down the frontend repo into the same directory: git clone https://github.com/IsaacSunoo/movie-tracker.git

Start the backend locally (localhost:3000)

npm start

In a new terminal, install the frontend and start on a new local server (localhost:3001)

npm install and npm start

## Learning Goals
This project was created for Turing School. This is our first try at implementing react-redux, Router, as well as incorporating a back-end to save user's accounts and favorites.
